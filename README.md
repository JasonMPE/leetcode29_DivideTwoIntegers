# leetcode29_DivideTwoIntegers
Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.
If it is overflow, return MAX_INT.


It seems to be a simple question,but it is easy for you to miss sth;
1.The trick is to do binary search division in negative number to handle boundary problem.

2.Shift can be used to solve this problem. We shift the divisor left until it just smaller than dividend but if we keep shifting one more bit, itâ€™s larger than dividend. Than we can add the shifted value to the result and subtract the shifted value from dividend. Keep doing this until dividend is smaller than divisor. In fact, every integer can be represented by a set of base 2 so that shifting can be used.

3.One thing needs to be mentioned is that we need to convert the integer to long type. Otherwise the abs() value of Integer INT_MIN will be quite strange.
